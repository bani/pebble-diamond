### App Description

It's time for smart jewellery.

They say diamonds are a girl's best friend, so now you can carry around this huge virtual diamond. Your Pebble Time Round will display this glorious 2cm of sparkling beauty, with a small clock in the center so that you can still know what time it is now. And of course it will shine even brighter with your backlight on!

And if your outfit calls for a different gem color, you have options! We also have available: aquamarine, sapphire, emerald, pink quartz, amethyst, ruby, and topaz.

It looks particularly good if you attach your Pebble to a chain to use it as a necklace. The perfect jewellery for the connected woman.
